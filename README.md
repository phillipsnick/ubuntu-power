# Ubuntu Power

## Introduction

Simple script to SSH into an Ubuntu host and execute a shutdown command.

## Installation

### Setting up Ubuntu



### Using Composer (recommended)

Add the following to your composer.json file

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phillipsnick/ubuntu-power": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install`


### Using Git submodules (untested)

    git submodule add https://github.com/phillipsnick/ubuntu-power.git 
    git submodule add https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib.git


## Usage

```php

```

Or see example inside Examples/SingleHost.php


## Notes

This is probably not the most secure way of achieving this task. As personally this is only run internally I don't deem this a big issue. 

Feel free to help improve this!
